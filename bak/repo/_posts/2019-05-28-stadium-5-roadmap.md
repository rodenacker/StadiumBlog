<p>We understand that you are making an investment in the Stadium platform so it&#8217;s important that we are transparent into where Stadium is going and what features will be included in the near future.</p>
<p>Since we introduced Stadium, our internal roadmap has been a living document. It changes weekly. We pride ourselves on the ability to move quickly and change directions to respond to demand, capture opportunities, and optimise resources to meet our client&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>Our roadmap is set out below. Although subject to change  we do hope it helps to provide some insight into where Stadium is going.</p>
<p>As always, our roadmap is completely defined by building the best product we can for our users. We need your feedback. You can continue to add suggestions in our community or <a href="https://origin.stadium.software/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a> at any time.</p>
