<span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span>
</a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The low-code web application builder has never looked better. All the features of the previous version are still available and Stadium 6 is reverse compatible with Stadium 5 applications.¬†</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the new features of Stadium 6:</span>
</p>
<h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Build in the dark</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There should be a law that every application needs a dark mode. It&#8217;s a preference of many developers and can help with eye strain during those long development sessions. Stadium 6 now has a fantastic-looking Dark mode.</span>
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1833" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/blogimages/stad6-dark1.png" alt="" width="1917" height="1023"/>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you prefer the classic Stadium theme as it was in Stadium 5, you can always switch between the two themes.¬†</span>
</p>
<h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s all about Speed</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A major part of developing a web application is to make constant, little changes because that label is just not right. Fine-tuning CSS with Stadium has been a joy since stadium 5 with the way styles are handled, but previewing could become a pain when you are working on a large application. This has been addressed in Stadium 6. Now when you click on the preview button you can see changes made much quicker than you would have in Stadium 5.¬†</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a speed test of previewing a very simple application in Stadium 5 versus Stadium 6:</span>
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1837" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/blogimages/StadiumSpeedTest-1-1.gif" alt="" width="1440" height="810"/>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When doing tests on more complex applications the performance increase is much more notable, but even with this very simple page, we can see a more than 500% improvement.¬†</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The preview speed is not the only performance improvement. Applications built with Stadium 6 will now perform much better because of the new Single Page Application (SPA) architecture.¬†</span>
</p>
<h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The SPA Future</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Single Page Applications (SPA) have become a staple of modern web applications. Given the fast responses, flexibility and praised user experience it&#8217;s easy to understand the appeal. The new SPA architecture leads to better performance of applications built with Stadium 6, and also a better user experience.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">SPAs have many uses but why are they so relevant? Some of the most common examples include Gmail, Google Maps and Facebook. If you have ever used one of these services you have first-hand experience of how user-friendly and responsive a SPA can be.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A highly simplified explanation would be: A SPA has only one HTML page with only data (in JSON format) travelling between the server and the page. The page is populated with this data via JavaScript. Because there is only one page, it only needs to be loaded once. Luckily Stadium 6 manages all of this for you, so you only need to build your application.¬†</span>
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1838" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/blogimages/Stadium-Showcase-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450"/>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the only change, there is a bunch of new features that will make development and application building much more feature rich.¬†</span>
</p>
<h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">New Features</span>
</h2>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stadium 6 introduces new features and improvements to existing features. Some notable mentions include:</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<a href="https://stadium.software/docs/actions/while/#__layout">
<i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While Loops</span>
</i>
</a>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; This action allows you to perform a loop in your script. There are also two ways to loop, a simple while loop (perform </span>
<i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">x</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> until the condition is met) or a Do while loop (perform </span>
<i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">x</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and then check if the condition is met, do this until the condition is met)</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lists </span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; This action allows you to create a list or array that you can use later in your script.¬†</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">New file upload events</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; The File Uploaded and File Deleted. What this means is that an event can be created or one, or both of these triggers. This event will trigger when the file is uploaded (or Deleted). An example can be that you want to display a message that a file was successfully loaded or deleted, or you want to log this somewhere. This was not present in Stadium 5 and now offers you much more flexibility, tracking and customization when working with files on your site.¬†</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">
<i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Object Editor</span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; This allows you to create and populate a complex type by using an editor.</span>
